===============================

Instructions on how to play the arcade game:

1. A player must be selected among the available sprite images at the bottom of screen -- using your keys that correspond to the number below the character. Player begins with 3 lives.

2. Once the character is chosen, player may use the arrow keys to maneuver through the rocks without hitting any enemy bugs. When player collides with enemies, lives available decrement. When player successfully reaches water, player scores and begins the process from below with increased difficulty level.

3. Upon exhausting the available lives, the game ends -- displaying scores and difficulty level achieved. Player can play another game by selecting another character from the selection.
